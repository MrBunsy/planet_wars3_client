random dots - then can dervive density of dots within circle of x radius at any point

could then find contours?  maybe colour inside contours different colours
then maybe some mechanism of density mapping to colour


bright star with lens flare idea:
random dots along the axis lines and centre of axis lines - do density of dots for brightness
maybe layer up 3 for RGB?
